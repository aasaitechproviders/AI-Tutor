                <h3>8.1 AI Accuracy and Reliability</h3>
                <p>While our AI systems strive for accuracy and relevance, AI-generated responses may contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. Users should verify AI-generated content independently and not rely solely on our AI platform for critical academic decisions or assessments.</p>
                
                <h3>8.2 Service Availability and Performance</h3>
                <p>Our AI Educational Platform is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not warrant that the AI services will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific educational needs at all times.</p>
                
                <h3>8.3 Educational Outcomes</h3>
                <p>We make no guarantees about academic performance, learning outcomes, or educational success resulting from use of our AI platform. Educational achievement depends on multiple factors beyond AI assistance.</p>
                
                <h3>8.4 AI Model Limitations</h3>
                <p>Our AI models are trained on available data and may have knowledge cutoffs, biases, or limitations. AI responses should be considered as supplementary educational support rather than authoritative academic sources.</p>
